          <h2>Towards a zero electricity bill</h2>
          <hr />
          <br />

          <p>
            Sick of getting big power bills? You've replaced all the old bulbs
            with LEDs, got a new fridge and super-efficient heat pump and youre
            still paying around $1200 a year? Your next step is to let HT Green
            work with you to design and install a system that uses solar, wind
            or geothermal that's guaranteed to wipe that power bill for now and
            into the future.

            Solar Photovoltaic systems have come of age. Installers now can
            guarantee reliable cost-free power to your home or business. ROI is
            now taking less time than ever thanks to the ever decreasing
            equipment costs and better technology.
            <br /><br />
            If you have battery storage such as a Tesla Powerwall or similar
            Lithium Ion chemistry solutions then you can take your savings even
            further.

            Energy from the earth. It sounds simple because it is. The earth is
            warmer than the air and we can use this to heat your home. HT Green
            can engineer a solution to fit your situation to give you free
            plentiful home warming energy year-round. <br /><br />
            Geothermal power is cost effective, reliable, and environmentally
            friendly, but has previously been geographically limited to areas
            near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have
            dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources,
            especially for direct applications such as home heating.
            <br /><br />
            Geothermal wells tend to release greenhouse gases trapped deep
            within the earth, but these emissions are much lower than those of
            conventional fossil fuels. As a result, geothermal power has the
            potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed instead
            of fossil fuels.

          <p>
            If you have the space and the aspect, we have the know-how to
            engineer a wind turbine system that generates electricity when the
            wind blows. Team a wind turbine with a solar PV system and you
            increase your energy generation potential. <br /><br />
            New to wind power? HT Green can show you more about how a wind
            turbine works, the benefits of wind energy and how a wind turbine is
            installed.
            <br /><br />
            If you're not sure on the type of turbine you need, before you buy
            from us, contact one of our wind power experts for the right advice.
